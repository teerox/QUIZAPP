# QUIZAPP
A simple educational quiz app for the Andela Learning Community (ALC) 7DayOfCode Challenge.

This app asks questions about basic history, elemenatry mathematics, and english grammar.

## How it works
First, it requests the user to input his/her name before the quiz can be started. 
Then it has 10 questions for the user to answer, of which it indicates if the answer was right or wrong, and also specifies the right answer in cases where the user got it wrong.
At the end of the quiz, it gives the user his/her total score, and states if he/she passed or failed (Pass mark is 50 points and above).
